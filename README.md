# MyTopete

MyTopete is a task manager purely made in C.
Originally it was a homework made for my Operating Systems class, but I decied to open the code to anyone.


When I took the class we were suggested to give the name of the software MyTop, but I decided to change to MyTopete, since topete means tuft (like in the hair style) in Portuguese, and I thought it would be a good joke :)
